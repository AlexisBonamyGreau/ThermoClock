# ThermoClock

In this project you can discover the software developped for my project ThermoClock.

ThermoClock is composed with a TFT screen, a temperature sensor and some RGB leds. Also, it uses the ST f103 microcontroller.

ThermoClock prints the temperature, and the date and hour provided by the Real Time Clock present in the microcontroller. Also, the temperature is printed on the leds. Depending on the temperature, the color of the leds will change.

The code presented here was produced by my collegue and me. To use it, you have to use also other libraries that I will not share here, because I am not the author.
